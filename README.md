Project 1:
World Layoffs Data Cleaning

This project focuses on data cleaning to prepare a messy dataset for accurate and reliable data analysis. Key steps included:
Removing Duplicates: Ensured unique records by identifying and deleting duplicate rows using ROW_NUMBER.
Standardizing Data: Enhanced consistency by trimming whitespaces, normalizing industry and country names, and converting dates to a uniform format.
Handling Missing Values: Addressed null and blank fields by imputing values based on existing data and flagging unresolvable gaps for further review.
Final Preparation: Removed temporary columns and validated the dataset to ensure it's ready for meaningful analysis.
This process ensures the data is clean, standardized, and complete, enabling accurate insights in subsequent analysis stages.
